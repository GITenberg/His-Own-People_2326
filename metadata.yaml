description: Many people who are traveling abroad take the opportunity to forge a
  new, albeit temporary, identity for themselves. In his quest to be welcomed among
  the upper crust in Europe, American Robert Russ Mellin creates a moneyed, cultured
  alter ego. However, before long, Mellin happens to encounter a man who is the embodiment
  of everything that he himself aspires to be. Will he survive this collision of the
  real and the imaginary?
